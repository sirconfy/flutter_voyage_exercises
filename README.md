## Answer to question 1
In Dart, the entry point is a function named `main`


## Answer to question 5 
Whatâ€™s the type of value?

   `var value = 10 / 2;`

  ` 10 / 2 `is a division operation that results in a floating-point number, and therefore, the variable `value` will be of type `double`.




  ## Answer to Question 6

1.  ` true && true` this is the logical AND operator (`&&`). If both are true then the result will be true.

 2. `false || false` This is the logical OR operator (`||`). Since both operands are false, the result is `false`.

 3. `(true && 1 != 2) || (4 > 3 && 100 < 1)`

 `(true && 1 != 2),`here is true because both conditions are satisfied.
`(4 > 3 && 100 < 1),` here is false because the second condition is not satisfied.

 The result is `true || false`, which evaluates to `true`.
